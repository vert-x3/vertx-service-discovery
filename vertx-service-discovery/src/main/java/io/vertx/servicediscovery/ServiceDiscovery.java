/**
 * Service Discovery main entry point.
 * <p>
 * The service discovery is an infrastructure that let you publish and find `services`. A `service` is a discoverable
 * functionality. It can be qualified by its type, metadata, and location. So a `service` can be a database, a
 * service proxy, a HTTP endpoint. It does not have to be a vert.x entity, but can be anything. Each service is
 * described by a {@link Record}.
 * <p>
 * The service discovery implements the interactions defined in the service-oriented computing. And to some extend,
 * also provides the dynamic service-oriented computing interaction. So, application can react to arrival and
 * departure of services.
 * <p>
 * A service provider can:
 * <p>
 * * publish a service record
 * * un-publish a published record
 * * update the status of a published service (down, out of service...)
 * <p>
 * A service consumer can:
 * <p>
 * * lookup for services
 * * bind to a selected service (it gets a {@link ServiceReference}) and use it
 * * release the service once the consumer is done with it
 * * listen for arrival, departure and modification of services.
 * <p>
 * Consumer would 1) lookup for service record matching their need, 2) retrieve the {@link ServiceReference} that give access
 * to the service, 3) get a service object to access the service, 4) release the service object once done.
 * <p>
 * A state above, the central piece of information shared by the providers and consumers are {@link Record records}.
 * <p>
 * Providers and consumers must create their own {@link ServiceDiscovery} instance. These instances are collaborating
 * in background (distributed structure) to keep the set of services in sync.
